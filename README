This is a clock animation in MATLAB featuring moving hands, a rotating 24-hour dial, sounds, and basic controls.
Run the file "analogClock".
It takes in one parameter, a string of the form 'hh:mm:ss' for the starting time e.g. '05:43:20'
It does not require an input, as it defaults to 12 o'clock.
I used "FreezeColors" by John Iversen to create multiple color schemes.
